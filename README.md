## Data Sources
The data used in this project is sourced from:
- `demos.csv`: Contains demo game data.
- `dlcs.csv`: Contains downloadable content data.
- `info_base_games.csv`: Contains information about base games.
- `gamalytic_cls_sales.csv`: Contains classification sales data.

## MS1 Description
In this milestone, we focused on applying multiple regression models to four distinct datasets provided as input files. The goal was to analyze each dataset, perform appropriate preprocessing, and fit various regression algorithms to model the underlying relationships in the data.
### Tasks Performed:
- Loaded and explored the four input data files.
- Conducted data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values , handling outliers , encoding, normalization , Feature selection , Feature Extraction).
- Split each dataset into training and testing sets.
- Applied and evaluated different regression models.
  
### Regression Models Used:
- Lasso regression --> For Feature Selection
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Bayesian Ridge Regression
- Random Forest
- LightGBM
- XGBoost

## MS2 Description
In this milestone, we focused on applying a range of classification models to four different datasets. The objective was to preprocess the data, train various classifiers, and evaluate their performance to determine the most effective models for each task.
